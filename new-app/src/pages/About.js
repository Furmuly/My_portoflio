                            Curiosity (the desire to Know) is the search engine that brings us to wonderful and unimaginable places,
                            The sense of curiosity in me was strong from childhood and always brought me to wonder how modern technology functions,
                            coming from a third-world country I didnâ€™t have the chance/opportunity to discover more and go far in this adventure,
                            being here in Switzerland was the perfect chance for me to feed my curiosity and passion for coding and technology,
                            nd so I decided to do an IT application development apprenticeship.</p>
